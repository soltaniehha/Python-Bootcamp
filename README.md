Most Notebooks come from [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) (free [100-page pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf) - backup link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10dt1dtlZAwgrEW9eQEE428a8IFgRgO3t/view?usp=sharing)) by Jake VanderPlas (under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license). Slight modifications and updates have been made in some places to keep its content up to date. *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential components of the Python language for data science and/or scientific programming. This material was written and tested using **Python 3.7**, and should work for any Python 3.X version.

Some content of a handful of notebooks come from [Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) by Jake VanderPlas (under the [MIT license](LICENSE-CODE).
